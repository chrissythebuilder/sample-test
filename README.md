example for class 2, learning more about Git

## Hello World!

Session 2 talks about using Git, the difference between Gihub and Gitlab - In this class, I learned the fundamentals of being able to build and maintain my code portoflio by using several functions of Git such as clone, add, commit, push, and pull. There was a visual presentation done by the instructor that made it very clear on how Git works. Amazing!
